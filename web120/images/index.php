 <p>Hi, I'm Chakrya (pronounced Chalk-re-ya.)! I have a background in events but am currently working on the web design certification at Seattle Central. Always having had an interest in UX, I enjoy creating good websites that are beautiful and easy to navigate.  I hope to apply this desirable skill set to creative roles at an organization with a humanitarian mission.</p>
<p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending time with my twin boys and watching them discover the world. Prior to having kids, I snowshoed, hiked, tried out new restaurants with friends, and traveled domestically and internationally.
